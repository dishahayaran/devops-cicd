**About this project**

This project aims to integrate GitHub repositories with Jenkins Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. By leveraging Jenkins, a widely-used automation server, and GitHub, a leading platform for version control and collaboration, this integration will streamline the development process, enabling automated build, test, and deployment workflows. The integration will facilitate developers in triggering CI/CD pipelines upon code changes, ensuring rapid feedback loops, efficient collaboration, and reliable delivery of software products.
